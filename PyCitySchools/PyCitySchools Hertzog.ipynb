    "When analyzing charter vs. district school, there was a significant gap between the overall passing scores for charter schools in comparison for district schools. Further tests to run on comparing district schools to charter schools would be analyzing if there was a specific school or schools which are an outlier that was pulling the average of district schools below those of character schools. \n",
    "There was not a significant range, again further statistical analysis could demonstrate the exact significance, between spending values per student. With the maximum being, $655 for a district school (Huang High school) and the minimum $578 for a charter school (Wilson High School). It appears District schools spend an average of $643 per student, while Charter schools spend $617 per student and students from Charter schools, while less is spent per student outperform (using Overall Passing Rate) Districts by 36.83%. Again, further research could show where the outliers are and what are the other contributing factors to District schools underperforming compared to their Charter counterparts. In addition, a linear regression could be ran to determine the correlation/or no correlation between spending per student and overall passing rates. \n",
    "Large schools (2,000-5,000 students) underperform their small schools and medium school counterparts by 31.6%, 32.4% respectively. Through analyzing there are both character and district schools which fall into the large schools category. Medium schools had the highest overall passing grades, however, not far behind were small schools. Further data to analyze regarding why large schools fall behind other schools could be teacher to student ratio. Then compare to small and medium sized schools and run a linear regression on those schools. \n"
